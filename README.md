The name of the this website project is the: Irish Craft Brew Review.

The overall strategy of the project is to recruit members, create a continuos 
flow of new content, and relate that information back to brewers for market 
research purposes. 

Thus, the focus of the website is to create a user-friendly 'social review hub' 
for anyone interested in Irish craft beers, using a simple, quickly learnable 
and visually appealing space, where visitors can:

1) read reviews; 
2) write their own reveiws; 
3) view features (video content and blog entries);
4) learn about upcoming events and releases;
5) sign up for membership; 
6) link in with other social medias.

The user-centric functionality of the website is achieved through adopting a 
tradtional linear mobile-first appraoch, with consistent structure (nav bar and 
page templates), predicatable outcomes with minimal steps (no more than two 
steps), and highly harmonious use of style and colour. 

Semantic HTML elements are used throughout (header, article, section, address 
etc.) to increase the 'compliance' of the website.

Further, a range of technologies are used to enhance functionality and style 
including: 

1) a fully customised and resposive top navbar (with hover icon grow elements 
imported from cdnjs);
2) a fully customised and responsive sub navbar with social media links and 
contact link (with hover icon grow elements imported from cdnjs);
3) bootstrap grid layouts throughout to ensure responsiveness;
4) bootstrap elements such as media obejcts and list groups with custom styling;
5) bootstrap buttons with custom styling to maintain consistency; 
6) various embedded responsive interactive elements (youtube, google maps and 
suvery monkey input field);
7) bootstrap javascript modal pup up window (for contact form);
8) and modern Roboto Slab and Lato google fonts 

The project was tested to ensure integrity accross all platforms.    

Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit (did not maintain good version control practice)

Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages (TBC)
